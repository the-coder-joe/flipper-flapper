# flipper-flapper
This is a controller for the beautiful flipper flapperator created by to goat Caleb Kurek


Plan:
    - Maybe we can build a compiler to compile all of the source files into one file for the esp-32 to interact with
    - If using raspberry pi, use either node or .NET server
    - Frameworks??

    List functionality here:
        - Want to include the ability to input arbitrary text on the server and have the flipper flapper display that text
        - Routines should be able to be added to display certain things triggered by certain events
        - Maybe control your light shit too idk
